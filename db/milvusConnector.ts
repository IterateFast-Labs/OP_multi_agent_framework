/**
 * @file milvusConnector.ts
 * @description Placeholder for Milvus DB connection and operations.
 * 
 * This file will handle the logic for connecting to a Milvus vector database instance.
 * It will export functions for saving, querying, and managing vector embeddings
 * related to the AI agent outputs and decisions.
 * 
 * Future functions to implement:
 * - connect(): Establishes and manages the connection to Milvus.
 * - saveResults(results: object): Takes the final state of the application and saves it.
 *   This would involve creating embeddings for textual data and storing them in a collection.
 * - searchSimilar(queryVector: number[]): Finds similar past decisions or analyses.
 * - disconnect(): Gracefully closes the connection.

// Example of a placeholder function
export const saveResultsToMilvus = async (results: object): Promise<{ success: boolean; message: string }> => {
  console.log("Attempting to save results to Milvus DB...");
  console.log(JSON.stringify(results, null, 2));

  // This is a mock implementation. In a real scenario, you would use the Milvus Node.js SDK
  // to connect to the database and perform insertion operations.
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Mock save operation complete.");
      resolve({ success: true, message: "Results successfully saved to Milvus (mock)." });
    }, 1000);
  });
